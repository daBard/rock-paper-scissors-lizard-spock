# rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock
An assignment in the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The assignment was to make a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game, but I wanted the challenge of adding Lizard and Spock into the mix.

This was an excellent way of getting a hang of the basics and some day, maybe, I'll make it learn based on gathered statistics.
